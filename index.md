Welcome to the Ajioka Lab
=========================

A “top-down” systems biology approach is employed to investigate the co-evolution of 
host-parasite interactions and disease pathology.  The obligate intracellular protozoan 
parasite _Toxoplasma gondii_ serves as the model pathogen to look at how the genetics, cell 
signaling and physiology of how the host and parasite interact to determine the spectrum 
of pathologies associated with toxoplasmosis.

Engineering genetic systems through the “bottom-up” approach of synthetic biology affords 
the possibility to construct genetic parts, devices and systems for useful purposes. The 
bacteria _E. coli_ and _Bacillus subtilis_ serve as the working “chassis” upon which we build 
new genetic systems to solve foundational problems in genetic circuitry and pragmatic 
problems for biosensors.
