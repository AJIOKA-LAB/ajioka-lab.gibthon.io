<!-- Unfortunately, the flavour of markdown github uses doesn't support markdown within HTML block elements (i.e. div), which are required by the University theme, so we'll have to write entries in HTML.
There's a template below - just copy-paste and fill in the relevent details.
Uploading an image directly isn't currently supported by github (Nov 2015), so you'll have to pull the repository, commit the extra images and push back using git.

Postdoctoral Researchers

<h2>Mario Juhas</h2>
<p>I work in the field of synthetic biology of bacteria. Previously I worked at the University of Zurich
and the University of Oxford in synthetic biology and functional genomics of bacteria. I received 
Diploma with Honours (summa cum laude) for the results of MSc and undergraduate studies in 
molecular genetics of microorganisms and PhD in functional genomics of bacteria. Proven track 
record in functional genomics and synthetic biology of bacteria is evidenced by numerous 
publications in the peer-reviewed journals. My projects involved collaborations within and across 
teams. I gained education and professional experience in four countries and I can communicate in 6 
languages.
</p><p>
My current research is focused on the following areas. 
</p><p>
1. Primary: High molecular weight DNA assembly, integration and inter-chassis transfer. This 
includes developing novel DNA assembly and chromosomal integration strategies and 
developing systems for the efficient and reliable transfer of the high molecular weight DNA, 
including whole metabolic pathways between chassis.
</p><p>
2. Secondary: Engineering tailor-made genomes and minimal cell factories. This includes
engineering tailor-made genomes and minimal cells for industrial application and 
investigating fundamental biological functions encoded by essential genes.

<h2>Orr Yarkoni</h2>
<p>I’m a postdoc in the lab working primarily on the Arsenic Biosensor Collaboration project. I’m a Synthetic Biologist with a background in Genetics and Nanomaterials. My interests mostly revolve around Synthetic Biology, biosensors, electron transfer pathways and chimeric proteins, but I’m always happy to collaborate on anything I find interesting. 
</p><p>
In my spare time I enjoy cooking – a hobby which I take almost as seriously as my work – and the usual: film, music, art and literature (my favourite book is “The Count of Monte Cristo”).</p>

<h2>Peter Davenport</h2>
<p>Peter Davenport read Natural Sciences (BA and MSci) at Cambridge University, specialising in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Peter's PhD research explored interactions between the intercellular signalling and metabolism of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and was conducted in the Welch and Griffin Groups of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge. His current research comprises development of in vitro and in vivo genetic biosensors with applications spanning heavy metal detection to the interrogation of behavioural neuroanatomy. These current projects provide interesting testbeds for developing and exploring the limits of simple biological computing elements.</p>

<h2>Bo Shiun</h2>
<p>I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, immigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and went to the United States for college. I am beyond blessed to be pursuing a PhD in Pathology at Cambridge on a Gates Cambridge Scholarship, and I am sincerely grateful for and deeply indebted to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for making my study possible.
</p><p>
As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, I worked in the Toxoplasmosis Research Institute under the guidance of Professor Rima McLeod. <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a parasite that infects over one-third of the world’s population. When a pregnant woman acquires this parasite for the first time during gestation, the parasite can be transmitted to her foetus. Foetal ocular and brain damage may ensue. Encephalitis caused by the parasite kills about 15-20% of patients with AIDS. In short, damages as a result of <i>T. gondii</i> infections predominantly affect the eyes and brains of the newborn and the immunocompromised. Existing medicines often result in toxicities and hypersensitivities, so novel medicines are needed. Through my undergraduate work, I helped develop a novel paradigm that can potentially deliver medicines across multiple membrane barriers and into actively replicating <i>T. gondii</i> (Lai, et al.). More importantly, this approach is applicable to deliver inhibitors into encysted, dormant parasites, which not only possess the ability to recrudesce but are also impervious to existing treatment. The process through which parasites respond to external stress by switching from the active form to the dormant and incurable form remains unclear to the scientific community. 
</p><p>
At Cambridge, I work with Dr. James Ajioka to investigate mechanisms of <i>T. gondii</i> invasion and further our understanding of parasite-host interactions that could potentially be exploited for future therapeutics.</p>

<h2>Konstanze Schott</h2>
<p>I have studied Pharmacy at the University of Kiel in Germany. As part of my course I completed a 
research training in the Cancer Biomarkers and Prevention Group in the Department of Cancer 
Studies at the University of Leicester. Currently, I am a PhD student in a collaboration between Jim 
Ajioka’s group in the Department of Pathology and Kathryn Lilley’s group in the Department of 
Biochemistry. My PhD project explores the effects of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> on the host cell 
phosphoproteome and exosome secretion using molecular biology tools including proteomics. This 
project gives a better understanding on how the apicomplexan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is able to 
modulate the host cell environment and on what role exosomes might play in the host immune 
response to parasite infection.</p>

<h2>Haydn King</h2>
<p>Haydn started a PhD in the Ajioka Lab in 2014, working on part characterisation and system design in <i>Bacillus Subtilis</i>. He is particularly interested in developing regulatory structures which are tolerant of the large amounts of noise present in biological systems. Prior to starting his PhD, Haydn completed a degree in Engineering at the University of Cambridge specialising in Information and Computer Engineering.</p>
