_Toxoplasma gondii_: parasitic subversion of host function
========================================================

The protozoan phylum Apicomplexa is arguably the most important group of parasitic pathogens responsible for human and animal disease. According to recent WHO figures, malaria (_Plasmodium spp._) alone produces global morbidity and mortality figures into the hundreds-of-millions affected people each year. The encephalitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii infection kills an estimated 15-20% of all AIDS patients. Livestock losses and the implementation of control measures for avian coccidiosis (_Eimeria spp._), costs the poultry industry millions of pounds annually. Despite decades of effort, there has been little progress in the prevention and treatment of apicomplexan diseases. Infection by members of the parasitic protozoan phylum _Apicomplexa_, such as _Plasmodium_ (malaria) and _Toxoplasma_ are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The problem is further compounded by the efficacy of drug treatment waning due to the emergence of drug resistance in the parasites in questions.

Our work uses genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic methods to further our understanding of host-parasite interactions during _Toxoplasma gondii_ infection. Specifically, we study the manner in which the parasite controls gene expression for growth and development, and how the parasite disrupts host function through protein secretion. These methods and the data generated represent a major step towards understanding the host-parasite interaction and has applications ranging from defining genes involved with pathogenesis to investigating drug action in vitro.
