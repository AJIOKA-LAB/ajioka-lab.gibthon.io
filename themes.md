Synthetic Biology
=================

Genome Maipulation
==================

The lack of suitable chromosomal integration loci is among the main hurdles of the _E. coli_ and _B. subtilis_ engineering efforts. We developed a Î» red recombinase-mediated method for integration of genetic circuits into the _E. coli_ chromosome. Furthermore, we identified and validated a number of reliable integration target loci within _E. coli_ flagellar regions. 

Although the vast majority of good DNA assembly and editing tools are in _E. coli_, other organisms, such as _B. subtilis_ or _Marchantia polymorpha_ are better hosts for certain applications. This necessitates development of systems for reliable interchassis transfer of high molecular weight DNA. We constructed integrative bacterial artificial chromosomes (iBACs) for efficient integration into _B. subtilis_ chromosome. We are also engineering autolysing cells for inducible interchassis transfer of big DNA molecules. As part of the OpenPlant BBSRC/EPSRC initiative, we are using _M. polymorpha_ as a model plant system for the introduction of large synthetic DNA constructs into both the plastid and nuclear genomes. This will require the design and construction of open-source BACs and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors as shuttle systems for large DNA constructs and the design of open-source plastid genome vectors for chloroplast transformation.


_Toxoplasma gondii_: parasitic subversion of host function
========================================================

The protozoan phylum Apicomplexa is arguably the most important group of parasitic pathogens responsible for human and animal disease. According to recent WHO figures, malaria (_Plasmodium spp._) alone produces global morbidity and mortality figures into the hundreds-of-millions affected people each year. The encephalitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii infection kills an estimated 15-20% of all AIDS patients. Livestock losses and the implementation of control measures for avian coccidiosis (_Eimeria spp._), costs the poultry industry millions of pounds annually. Despite decades of effort, there has been little progress in the prevention and treatment of apicomplexan diseases. Infection by members of the parasitic protozoan phylum _Apicomplexa_, such as _Plasmodium_ (malaria) and _Toxoplasma_ are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The problem is further compounded by the efficacy of drug treatment waning due to the emergence of drug resistance in the parasites in questions.

Our work uses genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic methods to further our understanding of host-parasite interactions during _Toxoplasma gondii_ infection. Specifically, we study the manner in which the parasite controls gene expression for growth and development, and how the parasite disrupts host function through protein secretion. These methods and the data generated represent a major step towards understanding the host-parasite interaction and has applications ranging from defining genes involved with pathogenesis to investigating drug action in vitro.
